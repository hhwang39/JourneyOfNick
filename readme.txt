1. PLEASE READ THE STORY
Nick is the priest in the village. Actually he is half-demon-half-human. His dad is a demon who died a long time ago, and his mom is a human. One day, evil monsters have invaded his villages and he tries to save his village by killing all the monsters and the boss. During his journey he realizes his true power - the power he inherited from his dad. Can he save the village and kill the boss at the end? Please play.
2. left and right key moves the player left to right and up key makes player jump. You can attack by z key(or A key in gameboy).
3. It was from sprites websites and I do not know which game these sprites were used. CREIDT: www.spriters-recource.com/other_systems/disgaed2/
4. I used DMA a lot. I used to copy a tiles and images to charblock, screenblock, copy shadowOAM to SPRITEMEM. I also used it to make bitmap background.
5. Two different way of animation. Enemy's animation is done by counter. If it was img1 used then change to img2 and so on and so forth. Player's animation is done by delay. You draw and delay it -> draw it and delay, so it does not update so fast. 
6. uhm.... make vba and press enter or start button. Maybe use fingers?
7. you kill everything
8. your health goes down below 0. Health is indicated in bottom corner.
9. I have implemented mosaic, animation, multiple stage, text system, screen moving.
10. Everything so far works fine. However, the boss seems to come out from nowhere somehow( which adds more suspense? maybe). Also, when you resize image and use brandon tools, it acutally blurs the image and you see the whole square, which I couldn't fix it. I couldn't explain all my story in game, so I have to explain it here.... 
GOOD LUCK ON PLAYING
